# Ageas Java Engineer Interview Test

## Assumptions and Clarifications

### Exercise2:

1. The assertion for Exercise2Test.testCase4 is not explicitly covered in the requirements. I have assumed that the "0001" should be treated as default.
2. Return messages (String) are formatted according to test cases rather than 0 and result as specified in requirements.
